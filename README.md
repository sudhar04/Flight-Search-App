## 🧩 Problems Faced & How I Solved Them

- **Challenge: Handling Real-Time Flight Data**  
  I initially struggled with managing dynamic data updates.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Used React state management and mock API responses to simulate real-time updates.  

- **Challenge: Responsive UI on All Devices**  
  The Bootstrap grid sometimes overlapped with custom CSS.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Carefully used media queries and Bootstrap’s responsive utilities to fix layout issues.  

- **Challenge: Integrating 3D Animations**  
  Adding animations without slowing down the app was tricky.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Optimized the animation library and used lightweight 3D assets.  

- **Challenge: Building the Chatbot**  
  Making the chatbot respond meaningfully was difficult at first.  
  ✅ **Solution:** Integrated a simple rule-based chatbot to handle common queries effectively.

## 🎯 Outcome
This project strengthened my knowledge of React, Bootstrap, and API integration. By adding animations and a chatbot, I learned how to improve user engagement and usability. The app demonstrates my ability to build dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly web applications.
